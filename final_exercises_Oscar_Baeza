3. Describe the workflow of a ChIP-seq experiment (experimental part)

	1: Use formaldehyde to glue ALL proteins bound to the DNA at a certain 
	   time point with the DNA chain
	2: Digest DNA into small fragments, like 300bp, fragments
	3: We capture the DNA bound protein we are interested in with an antibody
	   directed to this one attached with a bead
	4: We capture the primary antibody with a second antibody capturin this one
	   and we wash away all the remaining proteins and DNA
	5: The formaldehide gluing is reversed by warming and we wash away all the
	   proteins, including the histones
	6: The DNA fragments are sequenced, and the reads will be later processed 

4. Why do we need a control in ChIP-seq experiments?

We need the control samples due mainly to two reasons:
	DNA brakage is not uniform, and this may lead to false-positives in 
	open-chromatin regions. 
	Also, platform specific sequencing can increase the nonuniformity of the sample.
These control samples are utilized in the step of peak calling. 

5.Explain at which stage of a ChIP-seq processing analysis and how we combine 
the information of ChIP and control reads. Describe the output files we get if
we are using the tool MACS2.

We combine this information at the peak-calling step. In this step we compare
the peaks in the Chip files vs the control files, and we get the positions in which 
the histone maks or the TF are bound in the genome.
	
The output files are wiggle and BED files. These are the human readable 
versions, and the binary compressed files are called BigWig and BigBed. The wiggle
files store continuous data about the position and its signal associated, resulting
from the comparison between experiment vs control. The Bed file contains genomic
positions, with chr, start and end as obligatory data and other data can be also 
introduced in it. Used to represent genomic segments, either of gene coordinates or 
the genomic location of any signal (Chip experiment) 

6. What is a pipeline? In the case of the ENCODE ChIP-seq pipeline, which steps of 
the analysis of ChIP-seq data does it contain?

A pipeline is an agregation of steps to do a definde process. In this case, to 
obtain the bigBed and bigWig files from our samples. It contains the following steps:
Sequencing - as a result, we get FASTQ files
Mapping - resulting in BAM files
Peak calling - agregating the contorl and the Chip experiment, resulting in bigBed
and bigWig files.

9. What is an aggregation plot? Which tool do we use to generate one? Which input data 
do we need? Have a look at the aggregation plot done during the hands-on. Are the plots consistent
between the two tissues? Is this what you would expect, given the relationship between H3K4me3 
and gene expression? Why is it important to know the approximate location of a specific histone 
mark with respect to the gene?

An aggregation plot is useful to represent continuous data, in this case the Chip signal versus
the genolmic coordinates. We will use an R wrapper that will produce the plot with our
input data. As input we will need the bigWig files and a gencode annotation with the genomic
coordinates. Yes, both aggregation plots are very similar in both tissues, as expected. The
shape of the signal is the expected one at the 1000 most expressed genes, with a peak before 
the TSS and a bigger peak 100-250 bp after it. In comparison, in the 1000 least expressed genes
we can observe the same shape but with much more reduced signal values. The FC in the peak 
of the first genes is over 30, whereas the one of the least is over 5. As we know, this histone
mark is closely related with gene expression, so as expected the more expressed the gene are,
more histone mark signal is detected and the FC grows. It is important because if we know the 
approximate location, we can asses its function and we will be able to plot it and make comparisons
that would be impossible if we dont know where the marks are located in relation to the gene.

10. What type of plot are we using to visualize the correlation between two variables?
Have a look at the plots generated during the hands-on to assess the correlation
between expression and H3K4me3
Are these results consistent between the two tissues?
Would you expect this degree of correlation? Formulate an interpretation of the results

We will use a scatterplot with expression on the x axis and H3K4me3 FC in the y axis. Yes, 
they are consistent in both tissues having the same relation between the gene expression 
and H3K4me3 signal. Actually we expected more correlation between both variables. This difference
is due to the differences in range of the expression, going from -x to +x and the range of the 
histone modifications, going from 0 to 4. This smaller range is due to the DNA configuration, having
two copies of the gene and having two histones per gene, with two marking locations in this process.
This difference prevents the correlation to be as accurate as we could expect.  

11.During the hands-on session, we have checked the level of expression of genes with 
tissue-specific H3K4me3 marking.
Are these results consistent with the degree of correlation we have observed in point8?
Do you observe any unexpected behavior?
How would you relate the presence of genes with tissue-specific marking with the GO
terms obtained?

Yes, they are consistent with what we have found so far. The only strange behaviour is 
having so many inmunology genes expressed as higly as thay are in stomach. In stomach we
find many enriched genes in relation with immunology, as well as normal functions of the 
digestive system. In comparison, we lack these enriched genes in the sigmoid colon. In the 
latter tissue we have the GO enriched terms for the digestive and assimilation of nutrients 
GO terms.  

12. Have a look at the Venn diagram generated in the last task.
Comment on the number of peaks shared: is there more sharing between peaks of different
type in the same tissue (e.g.H3K4me3 & POLR2A of stomach), or between peaks of the same
type in different tissues (e.g.H3K4me3 of stomach and sigmoid colon)?

We have many more sharing of peaks from H3K4me3 shared between tissues than not, and we 
also share between tissues the peaks of POLR2A. The point with more intersection is the 
union of the four separation, sharing between stomach,sigmoid colon of H3K4me3 and both
tissues in POLR2A.
